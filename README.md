I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in the Department of Philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I completed my PhD in philosophy at the University of Toronto in 2023. I work mainly in the philosophy of language and epistemology, and my current research focuses on inquiry and questions.
